/**
 * ðŸŽ¯ QUICK INTERVIEW GUIDE: Lock Fairness in ReentrantLock
 * 
 * 1. What is Lock Fairness?
 *    - Policy that determines which thread gets the lock when multiple threads are waiting
 *    - Fair Lock: First-come-first-served (FIFO ordering)
 *    - Unfair Lock: No guaranteed order (default behavior)
 * 
 * 2. Key Points for Interview:
 *    a) Fair Lock (new ReentrantLock(true)):
 *       - Threads acquire lock in the order they requested it
 *       - More predictable behavior
 *       - Lower throughput (10-20% slower)
 *       - Prevents thread starvation
 * 
 *    b) Unfair Lock (new ReentrantLock() or new ReentrantLock(false)):
 *       - No guaranteed order of lock acquisition
 *       - Better throughput
 *       - Possible thread starvation
 *       - Default behavior
 * 
 * 3. When to Use Fair Locks:
 *    - When thread starvation is a concern
 *    - Need predictable lock acquisition order
 *    - Can afford performance overhead
 * 
 * 4. When to Use Unfair Locks:
 *    - Need maximum throughput
 *    - Short lock holding times
 *    - Thread starvation isn't a concern
 * 
 * ðŸš¨ Common Interview Questions:
 * Q1: Why is unfair locking default?
 * A1: Better performance, reduced thread suspension/resumption
 * 
 * Q2: Performance impact of fair locks?
 * A2: 10-20% slower due to strict ordering maintenance
 * 
 * Q3: Can fairness be changed after creation?
 * A3: No, must be set in constructor

   /**
    * ðŸ”’ Resource Access Pattern with Fair Lock
    * 
    * Implementation Points:
    * 1. lock() - With fair lock:
    *    - Threads queue up in arrival order
    *    - Earlier requests get priority
    * 
    * 2. Try-Finally Pattern:
    *    - Ensures lock release
    *    - Handles exceptions safely
    * 
    * 3. Sleep Simulation:
    *    - Demonstrates lock holding time
    *    - Shows thread ordering effects
    * 
    * Interview Tip: This pattern shows:
    * - Proper lock usage
    * - Thread safety
    * - Resource cleanup

    * - Observe predictable execution sequence
