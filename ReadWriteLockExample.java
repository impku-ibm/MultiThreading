/**
 * ðŸŽ¯ QUICK INTERVIEW GUIDE: ReadWriteLock Pattern
 * 
 * 1. What is ReadWriteLock?
 *    - Advanced locking mechanism providing two locks:
 *      a) Read Lock: Multiple threads can read simultaneously
 *      b) Write Lock: Exclusive access for writing
 * 
 * 2. Key Benefits:
 *    - Better concurrency than simple locks
 *    - Multiple readers can access simultaneously
 *    - Write operations get exclusive access
 *    - Prevents read-write and write-write conflicts
 * 
 * 3. Rules of ReadWriteLock:
 *    - Multiple threads can hold read lock
 *    - Only one thread can hold write lock
 *    - If write lock is held, no read locks allowed
 *    - If any read lock is held, no write lock allowed
 * 
 * 4. Use Cases:
 *    - Cache implementations
 *    - Read-heavy scenarios
 *    - Data structures with frequent reads
 *    - When reads outnumber writes
 * 
 * ðŸš¨ Common Interview Questions:
 * Q1: When to use ReadWriteLock over ReentrantLock?
 * A1: When reads are more frequent than writes and concurrent reads are safe
 * 
 * Q2: Can multiple threads read simultaneously?
 * A2: Yes, multiple threads can hold read lock at same time
 * 
 * Q3: What happens during write lock?
 * A3: All other operations (read/write) are blocked
 * 
 * Q4: Performance implications?
 * A4: Better than simple locks for read-heavy scenarios
